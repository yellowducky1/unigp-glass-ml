# unigp-glass-ml

## Project Overview
As part of a forensic-themed machine learning challenge, I collaborated in a team of four to develop a glass classification model to support a criminal investigation. The goal was to analyse glass fragments found at a crime scene and determine whether any originated from the suspect's vehicle windows.

## My Contribution
I focused on data preprocessing and visualization, which laid the foundation for effective model training and evaluation:
- Cleaned and standardized datasets from UK, US, and EU sources.
- Handled missing values and corrected zero entries in critical features like Silicon (Si).
- Merged regional datasets into a unified format.
- Created multi-panel plots to explore feature distributions and visualize model performance.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machines

## Results
- Compared performance across multiple classifiers.
- Visualized model predictions versus actual values.
- Explored hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
